                    I'm Devon McFarlen, 21 years old, a Unity Developer, and an aspiring Fullstack Javascript developer.
                    I've been programming for most of my life, starting with scratch back when I was 8, moving
                    on to Game Maker a few years after that, where I took both 2D and 3D game development courses.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Then in my sophomore year of highschool I started taking computer science classes, where I learned
                    Java. I took those classes for the rest of highschool, going into computer science 2 and AP Compsci.
                    At the same time I also took the Game Design 1 and 2 courses at the Technology Exploration and Career Center
                    where I learned and got ceritfied in Unity Development for both 2D and 3D game design and development.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In late 2022 I got a job as a Unity Developer at Flite Golf, and worked for them for a bit over 8 months
                    before the CTO got removed from his position, and most of the development team got let go. I'm currently taking
                    a Fullstack Javascript Development course from UT Austin in order to increase my skillset and progress my career.
