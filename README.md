  ## Description <a name="description"></a>
  
  I remade my original professional portfolio into a react project. I did this to get used to working in react, and it helped improve the ability to quickly make changes or add things to my porfolio by making it more modular.
  <br>
  Doing this did a lot for helping me to properly understand how to use react at a basic level, in order to get a webpage up and running.
